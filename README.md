## ❓ Why MyDuck ❓

While MySQL and Postgres are the most popular open-source databases for OLTP, their performance in analytics often falls short. DuckDB, on the other hand, is built for fast, embedded analytical processing. MyDuck Server lets you enjoy DuckDB's high-speed analytics without leaving the (MySQL|Postgres) ecosystem.

With MyDuck Server, you can:

- **Set up an isolated, fast, and real-time replica** dedicated to ad-hoc analytics, batch jobs, and LLM-generated queries, without exhausting or corrupting your primary database 🔥
- **Accelerate existing MySQL & Postgres analytics** to new heights through DuckDB's high-speed engine with minimal changes 🚀
- **Enable richer & faster connectivity** between modern data manipulation & analysis tools and your MySQL & Postgres data 🛠️
- **Go beyond MySQL & Postgres syntax** with DuckDB's advanced SQL features to expand your analytics potential 🦆
- **Run DuckDB in server mode** to share a DuckDB instance with your team or among your applications 🌩️
- **Build HTAP systems** by combining (MySQL|Postgres) for transactions with MyDuck for analytics 🔄
- and much more! See below for a full list of feature highlights.

MyDuck Server isn't here to replace MySQL & Postgres — it's here to help MySQL & Postgres users do more with their data. This open-source project provides a convenient way to integrate high-speed analytics into your workflow while embracing the flexibility and efficiency of DuckDB.

## ✨ Key Features


- **Blazing Fast OLAP with DuckDB**: MyDuck stores data in DuckDB, an OLAP-optimized database known for lightning-fast analytical queries. DuckDB enables MyDuck to execute queries up to 1000x faster than traditional MySQL & Postgres setups, making complex analytics practical that were previously unfeasible.

- **MySQL-Compatible Interface**: MyDuck implements the MySQL wire protocol and understands MySQL syntax, allowing you to connect with any MySQL client and run MySQL-style SQL. MyDuck automatically translates your queries and executes them in DuckDB.

- **Postgres-Compatible Interface**: MyDuck implements the Postgres wire protocol, enabling you to send DuckDB SQL directly using any Postgres client. Since DuckDB's SQL dialect [closely resembles PostgreSQL](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/dialect/postgresql_compatibility.html), you can speed up existing Postgres queries with minimal changes.

- **Raw DuckDB Power**: MyDuck provides full access to DuckDB's analytical capabilities through raw DuckDB SQL, including [friendly SQL syntax](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/dialect/friendly_sql.html), [advanced aggregates](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/aggregates), [remote data source access](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/data_sources), [nested data types](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/data_types/overview#nested--composite-types), and more.

- **Zero-ETL**: Simply start replication and begin querying! MyDuck can function as a MySQL replica or Postgres standby, replicating data from your primary server in real-time. It works like standard MySQL & Postgres replication - using MySQL's `START REPLICA` or Postgres' `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` commands, eliminating the need for complex ETL pipelines.

- **Consistent and Efficient Replication**: Thanks to DuckDB's [solid ACID support](https://duckdb.org/2024/09/25/changing-data-with-confidence-and-acid.html), we've carefully managed transaction boundaries in the replication stream to ensure a **consistent data view** — you'll never see dirty data mid-transaction. Plus, MyDuck's **transaction batching** collects updates from multiple transactions and applies them to DuckDB in batches, significantly reducing write overhead (since DuckDB isn’t designed for high-frequency OLTP writes).

- **HTAP Architecture Support**: MyDuck works well with database proxy tools to enable hybrid transactional/analytical processing setups. You can route DML operations to (MySQL|Postgres) and analytical queries to MyDuck, creating a powerful HTAP architecture that combines the best of both worlds.

- **Bulk Upload & Download**: MyDuck supports fast bulk data loading from the client side with the standard MySQL `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` command or the  PostgreSQL `COPY FROM STDIN` command. You can also extract data from MyDuck using the PostgreSQL `COPY TO STDOUT` command.

- **End-to-End Columnar IO**: In addition to the traditional row-oriented data transfer in MySQL & Postgres protocol, MyDuck can also send query results and receive data uploads in columnar format, which can be significantly faster for high-volume data. This is implemented on top of the standard Postgres `COPY` protocol with extended columnar format support, e.g., `COPY ... TO STDOUT (FORMAT parquet | arrow)`, allowing you to use the standard Postgres client library to interact with MyDuck in an optimized way.

- **Standalone Mode**: MyDuck can run in standalone mode without replication. In this mode, it is a drop-in replacement for (MySQL|Postgres), but with a DuckDB heart. You can `CREATE TABLE`, transactionally `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` data, and run blazingly fast `SELECT` queries.

- **DuckDB in Server Mode**: If you aren't interested in MySQL & Postgres but just want to share a DuckDB instance with your team or among your applications, MyDuck is also a great solution. You can deploy MyDuck to a server, connect to it with the Postgres client library in your favorite programming language, and start running DuckDB SQL queries directly.

- **Seamless Integration with Dump & Copy Utilities**: MyDuck plays well with modern MySQL & Postgres data migration tools, especially the [MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/en/) and [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html). For MySQL, you can load data into MyDuck in parallel from a MySQL Shell dump, or leverage the Shell’s `copy-instance` utility to copy a consistent snapshot of your running MySQL server to MyDuck. For Postgres, MyDuck can load data from a `pg_dump` archive.

## 📊 Performance

Typical OLAP queries can run **up to 1000x faster** with MyDuck Server compared to MySQL & Postgres alone, especially on large datasets. Under the hood, it's just DuckDB doing what it does best: processing analytical queries at lightning speed. You are welcome to run your own benchmarks and prepare to be amazed! Alternatively, you can refer to well-known benchmarks like the [ClickBench](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/) and [H2O.ai db-benchmark](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/) to see how DuckDB performs against other databases and data science tools. Also remember that DuckDB has robust support for transactions, JOINs, and [larger-than-memory query processing](https://duckdb.org/2024/07/09/memory-management.html), which are unavailable in many competing systems and tools.

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (recommended) for setting up MyDuck Server quickly.
- MySQL or PostgreSQL CLI clients for connecting and testing your setup.

### Installation

Get a standalone MyDuck Server up and running in minutes using Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 13306:3306 -p 15432:5432 apecloud/myduckserver:latest
```

This setup exposes:

- **Port 13306** for MySQL wire protocol connections.
- **Port 15432** for PostgreSQL wire protocol connections, allowing direct DuckDB SQL.

### Usage

#### Connecting via MySQL client

Connect using any MySQL client to run MySQL-style SQL queries:

```bash
mysql -h127.0.0.1 -P13306 -uroot
```

> [!NOTE]
> MySQL CLI clients version 9.0 and above are not yet supported on macOS. Consider `brew install mysql-client@8.4`.

#### Connecting via PostgreSQL client

For full analytical power, connect to the Postgres port and run DuckDB SQL queries directly:

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 15432 -U postgres
```

### Replicating Data

We have integrated a setup tool in the Docker image that helps replicate data from your primary (MySQL|Postgres) server to MyDuck Server. The tool is available via the `SETUP_MODE` environment variable. In `REPLICA` mode, the container will start MyDuck Server, dump a snapshot of your primary (MySQL|Postgres) server, and start replicating data in real-time.

> [!NOTE]
> Supported primary database versions: MySQL>=8.0 and PostgreSQL>=13. In addition to the default settings,
logical replication must be enabled for PostgreSQL by setting `wal_level=logical`.
> For MySQL, GTID-based replication (`gtid_mode=ON` and `enforce_gtid_consistency=ON`) is recommended but not required.

```bash
docker run -d --name myduck \
  -p 13306:3306 \ 
  -p 15432:5432 \
  --env=SETUP_MODE=REPLICA \
  --env=SOURCE_DSN="<postgres|mysql>://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>"
  apecloud/myduckserver:latest
```
`SOURCE_DSN` specifies the connection string to the primary database server, which can be either MySQL or PostgreSQL.

- **MySQL Primary:** Use the `mysql` URI scheme, e.g.,  
  `--env=SOURCE_DSN=mysql://root:password@example.com:3306`

- **PostgreSQL Primary:** Use the `postgres` URI scheme, e.g.,  
  `--env=SOURCE_DSN=postgres://postgres:password@example.com:5432`

> [!NOTE]
> To replicate from a server running on the host machine, use `host.docker.internal` as the hostname instead of `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. On Linux, you must also add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to the `docker run` command.

### Initialize MyDuck Server with Custom SQLs

To initialize MyDuck Server by executing custom SQL statements once it’s ready, you can place the SQL statements in a file with the .sql extension and mount the file to either `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/mysql/` or `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/postgres/` in the Docker container. The choice between these directories depends on the protocol used for executing the SQL statements.

For instance:
```bash
# Execute init.sql on MySQL protocol
docker run -d -p 13306:3306 -p 15432:5432 --name=myduck -v ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/postgres/init.sql apecloud/myduckserver:latest

# Execute init.sql on PostgreSQL protocol
docker run -d -p 13306:3306 -p 15432:5432 --name=myduck -v ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/postgres/init.sql apecloud/myduckserver:latest
```

### Connecting to Cloud MySQL & Postgres

MyDuck Server supports setting up replicas from common cloud-based MySQL & Postgres offerings. For more information, please refer to the [replica setup guide](docs/tutorial/replica-setup-rds.md).

### HTAP Setup

With MyDuck's powerful analytics capabilities, you can create an hybrid transactional/analytical processing system where high-frequency data writes are directed to a standard MySQL or Postgres instance, while analytical queries are handled by a MyDuck Server instance. Follow our HTAP setup instructions to easily set up an HTAP demonstration:
* Provisioning a MySQL HTAP cluster based on [ProxySQL](docs/tutorial/mysql-htap-proxysql-setup.md) or [MariaDB MaxScale](docs/tutorial/mysql-htap-maxscale-setup.md).
* Provisioning a PostgreSQL HTAP cluster based on [PGPool-II](docs/tutorial/pg-htap-pgpool-setup.md)
